### General Overview

Description: 
The culminating project of a unit on P5 incorporating a thematic project on culture.  Students will have covered various shapes in P5 and have had lessons on basic HTML/CSS to design a simple web page which will showcase their Culture Project.  This would take place over  the course of 10-15 - 40 minute periods of CS.  The project will take 5-40 class periods.  Students will be using questions designed to help them design a project that tells about them and their culture.  They will use P5 with HTML/CSS.  They will be doing some work in groups to explore the significance of culture and work together on a joint project if they desire and are from similar cultures.  Most of the projects, however, will be individual.  They will do peer evaluations within class and share with other classes as presentations.  The projects will be housed on a web page with the use of HTML/CSS to showcase their P5 work.

This unit should be done at the beginning of the year with 8th graders that have had previous CS Experience with the programs listed. 
When: Class meets 5 days a week - 45 min per period
Grades: Grade 8 CS - Intro to p5

### Motivation for Unit

### We have decided to do this unit to help students get to know one another at the beginning of the year.  Students will get to know each other working on cultural projects and form supportive relationships through collaborative partnerships.  It's important to know one's own culture and share with others and get to know others culture's at the same time. Through this unit students will demonstrate new understandings of text based applications and utilize their developing skills to illustrate their cultural experiences.
