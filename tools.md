• Desribe 2 technological tools you currently use in your classroom. One of which should be a programming tool (if possible). Include:
   • The name of the tool.
   • What its general purpose is.
   • The class(es) you use it in.
   • How you use it in class.
   • Why you have selected that tool for that purpose?
  
 # Codepen  - (http://codepen.io)
 The general purpose of CodePen is to create HTML/CSS/JavaScript web pages.  I use this with my 8th grade class to begin learning how to transfer 
 their knowledge from Code.org's curriculum to a standard web editor. Codepen has space to write HTML tags, CSS coding, and JavaScript Code.  If you 
 use p5 you have to import the library, but I mostly use it for the HTML/CSS part.  Students can also see how their web pages turn out and the layout 
 of the page can be rearranged so that the students have their choice of how they want to view their page.  Once they have created a simple page with 
 basic HTML/CSS, I then go into teaching them how to use P5 JavaScript.  
 
 # P5 - (http://editor.p5JS.org) JavaScript
 
 The general purpose of P5 is to teach JavaScript in an environment that has a lot of references and a rich library of content.  Students will learn
 how to make basic shapes and learn how to use built in variables and add color for their first major project.  They will create an All About Me 
 project trying to use the shapes and color to design a project that tells something about themselves.  Once they have this created, I introduce to   them how to incorporate the HTML/CSS portion in the program.  They are better able to understand the coding part after the Codepen and Code.org lessons in this fashion.
